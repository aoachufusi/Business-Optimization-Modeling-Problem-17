# Modeling Problem 17
An automaker advertises with commercial spots on three types of TV programs: dramas (costing $150,000 per minute and seen by 8 million women and 4 million men), sports (costing $180,000 per minute and seen by 2 million women and 12 million men), and news (costing $130,000 per minute and seen by 4 million women and 5 million men).

(a) Write and solve an optimization model giving a strategy to reach at least 35 million women and 35 million men at least cost.

(b) Now do the same under the further stipulation that only one-minute long commercial spots can be used.
